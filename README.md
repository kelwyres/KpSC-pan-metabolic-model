# KpSC pan-metabolic model

*Klebsiella pneumoniae* species complex reference pan-metabolic reconstruction.

Model was constructed using the 37 *Klebsiella pneumoniae* Species Complex (*Kp*SC) isolates from [Hawkey et al, 2022](https://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.276289.121)


## Description of files

This repository contains files corresponding to the *Kp*SC reference pan-metabolic model. As these are not from a single genome, genomic information has been provided in multifasta files (.fna, .faa) instead of a .gbk 

| File      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| KpSC_pan-metabolic_model_v1.xml      | *Kp*SC pan metabolic model version 1 (.xml)       |
| KpSC_pan-metabolic_model_v1.json   | *Kp*SC pan metabolic model version 1 (.json)        |
| KpSC_pan-metabolic_model_v1_nucl.fna      | Coding sequences of gene reaction rules (GPRs) from *Kp*SC pan metabolic model version 1 (.fna)       |
| KpSC_pan-metabolic_model_v1_prots.faa   | Protein sequences of gene reaction rules (GPRs) from *Kp*SC pan metabolic model version 1 (.faa)        |
