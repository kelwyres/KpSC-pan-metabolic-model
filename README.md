# KpSC pan-metabolic model

*Klebsiella pneumoniae* Species Complex reference pan-metabolic model reconstruction.

Model was constructed using the 37 *Klebsiella pneumoniae* Species Complex (*Kp*SC) isolates from [Hawkey et al, 2022, *Genome Research*](https://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.276289.121)

This model was designed as a reference model for input into [Bactabolize](https://github.com/kelwyres/Bactabolize), to allow highly accurate, strain specific *Kp*SC metabolic models.


## Description of files

This repository contains files corresponding to the *Kp*SC reference pan-metabolic model. As these are not from a single genome, genomic information has been provided in multifasta files (.fna, .faa) instead of a .gbk. BiGG nomenclature is used.
